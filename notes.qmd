Investigate the following:

1. [x] Why some E_c are so large ? 
    The core part looks like a power-law with large E_c
2. [ ] Why some Îº are so large ?
    Overfitting of the energetic part (usually only 3 points)
3. [x] Why maxAE = 99999 ?
    `OMNI_HRO2_1MIN` covers a smaller time range than `OMNI_HRO_1MIN`
4. [ ] Why some J1 are negative ?
