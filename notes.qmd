Investigate the following:

1. [x] Why some E_c are so large ? 
    The core part looks like a power-law with large E_c
2. [ ] Why some κ are so large ?
    Overfitting of the energetic part (usually only 3 points)
3. [x] Why maxAE = 99999 ?
    `OMNI_HRO2_1MIN` covers a smaller time range than `OMNI_HRO_1MIN`
4. [ ] Why some J1 are negative ?

### κ part contribution

Comparison of spectral parameters: (a) total energy flux, (b) total number flux, (c) flux ratio from energetic particles, (d) energy flux ratio from energetic particles, and (e) averaged electron energy.

@fig-κ-ratio presents the total energy flux, total number flux, flux ratio from kappa distribution particles, energy flux ratio from kappa distributino and averaged electron energy —as functions of MLT and MLAT, sorted by AE index levels. The results indicate that the strongest contributions from energetic electrons are concentrated in the dawn sector at MLAT between approximately 65° and 85°. Although both the total number flux and total energy flux are lower in this region compared to the primary dayside precipitation region, the fractional contribution from the high-energy component is significantly larger.
