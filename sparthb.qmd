## Magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling

> The spectral distributions of auroral particles play a fundamental role in the construction of the global distribution of auroral particles and conductivities @mcintoshMapsPrecipitatingElectron2014


> The remaining limitations to OP-2013 most likely to be felt by users include a limitation to 30 keV (extrapolated to about 50 keV). Although higher energy precipitation contributes relatively little to the total energy budget, the deeper penetration into the atmosphere of high energy particles has important consequences for upper atmosphere chemistry. More detailed spectral information would also be quite useful for many modeling purposes.
